Webots based virtual environments for robotics

Usage : 
- Get the download of Webots at : https://www.cyberbotics.com/ and install it.
- Create a new directory 'webots' under your 'Documents' directory.
- Download the zip file with all worlds by pressing the green 'code' button on https://github.com/roboticas/virtual and select 'Download ZIP'.
- Unzip this file in a directory of your choosing.
- Goto the 'worlds' directory in this directory and copy its contents to the 'webots' directory that you just created.
- Open webots and select 'File->Open World...' and then load for example the linefollower.wbt world at 'Documents\webots\linefollower\worlds'.
- Make changes to the controller file at the right of your screen to change your robot. 
- Save the file and then compile by pressing F7. Look at possible error messages in the
  lower window, fix them.
- Run your simulation by pressing the 'play' icon in the top of the screen. Reset your simulation after each run by pressing the 'rewind' icon.
